# WATER-INTAKE-ANALYSIS
Personal Health Habit Analysis - Water Consumption


This project reflects a personal aspect of my life that I sought to improve: the habit of drinking more water. Motivated by a desire to better understand why I struggle with maintaining this healthy habit, I turned to the "Five Whys" technique to analyze the root causes behind my behavior.

Through this introspective analysis, I discovered that my approach to health has been primarily "fix it"-driven, rather than adopting a "preventive" mindset. This realization has been key in reframing how I approach health and wellness, and I wanted to quantify the data surrounding this habit for a clearer perspective.

To achieve this, I collected detailed data for a working week (27/05/2024 â€“ 31/05/2024), and conducted an analysis in Excel to uncover patterns, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement in my hydration habits. This project not only reflects a personal goal but also demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, problem-solving, and using data to drive personal development.

Key Highlights:
Personal Insight: Applied the "Five Whys" method to gain a deeper understanding of my habits and motivations.
Data-Driven Approach: Conducted a comprehensive Excel analysis using data collected over a week.
Outcome: Gained actionable insights into improving my health habits and understanding the psychology behind them.
Skills: Excel, Data Analysis, Root Cause Analysis, Self-Reflection, and Problem-Solving.
This project showcases my ability to leverage data analysis not only for professional purposes but also for personal growth. It highlights how analytical skills can be applied to solve real-world problems, even in the context of personal development.
